# Initial files to start a new project

## First thing first

**Install dependences**
```
npm install
```

**And run the file _run.sh_ if you use Unix system**
```
./run.sh
```

**Or run the gulp command**
```
gulp watch
```

The command _gulp watch_ will observe the files scss and js, and automatically save the css into the folder assets/css, and js files will be saved into assets/js folder. After save the files, gulp will refresh the browser.
